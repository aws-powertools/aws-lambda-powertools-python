???+note "Customizing the Swagger metadata"
	The `enable_swagger` method accepts the same metadata as described at [Customizing OpenAPI metadata](api_gateway.md#customizing-openapi-metadata).

The Swagger UI appears by default at the `/swagger` path, but you can customize this to serve the documentation from another path and specify the source for Swagger UI assets.
