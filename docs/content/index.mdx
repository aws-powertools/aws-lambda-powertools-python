import Note from "../src/components/Note"

Powertools is a suite of utilities for AWS Lambda functions that makes tracing with AWS X-Ray, structured logging and creating custom metrics asynchronously easier.

## Install

Powertools is available in PyPi. You can use your favourite dependency management tool to install it

* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `poetry add aws-lambda-powertools`
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html): `pip install aws-lambda-powertools`

**Quick hello world example using SAM CLI**

```bash:title=hello_world.sh
sam init --location https://github.com/aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-python
```

### Lambda Layer

Powertools is also available as a Lambda Layer. It is distributed via the [AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/what-is-serverlessrepo.html).

App | ARN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/eu-west-1/057560766410/aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer) | arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-1:057560766410:applications/aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer

If using SAM, you can include this SAR App as part of your shared Layers stack, and lock to a specific semantic version. Once deployed, it'll be available across the account this is deployed to.

```yaml
  AwsLambdaPowertoolsPythonLayer:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Application
    Properties:
      Location:
        ApplicationId: arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-1:057560766410:applications/aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer
        SemanticVersion: 1.3.1 # change to latest semantic version available in SAR
```

## Features

Utility | Description
------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Tracing](./core/tracer) | Decorators and utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
[Logging](./core/logger) | Structured logging made easier, and decorator to enrich structured logging with key Lambda context details
[Metrics](./core/metrics) | Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
[Bring your own middleware](.//utilities/middleware_factory) | Decorator factory to create your own middleware to run logic before, and after each Lambda invocation
[Parameters utility](./utilities/parameters) | Retrieve parameter values from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, AWS Secrets Manager, or Amazon DynamoDB, and cache them for a specific amount of time

## Environment variables

**Environment variables** used across suite of utilities.

Environment variable | Description | Utility
------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------
**POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME** | Sets service name used for tracing namespace, metrics dimension and structured logging | All
**POWERTOOLS_METRICS_NAMESPACE** | Sets namespace used for metrics | [Metrics](./core/metrics)
**POWERTOOLS_TRACE_DISABLED** | Disables tracing | [Tracing](./core/tracer)
**POWERTOOLS_TRACE_MIDDLEWARES** | Creates sub-segment for each custom middleware | [Middleware factory](./utilities/middleware_factory)
**POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT** | Logs incoming event | [Logging](./core/logger)
**POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_SAMPLE_RATE** | Debug log sampling | [Logging](./core/logger)
**LOG_LEVEL** | Sets logging level | [Logging](./core/logger)

## Debug mode

As a best practice, AWS Lambda Powertools logging statements are suppressed. If necessary, you can enable debugging using `set_package_logger`:

```python:title=app.py
from aws_lambda_powertools.logging.logger import set_package_logger

set_package_logger()
```

## Tenets

* **AWS Lambda only** – We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
* **Eases the adoption of best practices** – The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
* **Keep it lean** – Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time.
* **We strive for backwards compatibility** – New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
* **We work backwards from the community** – We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
* **Idiomatic** – Utilities follow programming language idioms and language-specific best practices.

_`*` Core utilities are Tracer, Logger and Metrics. Optional utilities may vary across languages._
