Powertools is a suite of utilities for AWS Lambda Functions that makes tracing with AWS X-Ray, structured logging and creating custom metrics asynchronously easier.

## Install

Powertools is available in PyPi. You can use your favourite dependency management tool to install it

* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `poetry add aws-lambda-powertools`
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html): `pip install aws-lambda-powertools`

## Features

* [Tracing](./core/tracer) - Decorators and utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
* [Logging](./core/logger) - Structured logging made easier, and decorator to enrich structured logging with key Lambda context details
* [Metrics](./core/metrics) - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
* [Bring your own middleware](./utilities/middleware_factory) - Decorator factory to create your own middleware to run logic before, and after each Lambda invocation

## Tenets

* **AWS Lambda only** – We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
* **Eases the adoption of best practices** – The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
* **Keep it lean** – Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time. 
* **We strive for backwards compatibility** – New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
* **We work backwards from the community** – We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
* **Idiomatic** – Utilities follow programming language idioms and language-specific best practices.

_`*` Core utilities are Tracer, Logger and Metrics. Optional utilities may vary across languages._

## Environment variables

**Environment variables** used across suite of utilities.

Environment variable | Description | Utility
------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------
**POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME** | Sets service name used for tracing namespace, metrics dimension and structured logging | all
**POWERTOOLS_METRICS_NAMESPACE** | Sets namespace used for metrics | [Metrics](./core/metrics)
**POWERTOOLS_TRACE_DISABLED** | Disables tracing | [Tracing](./core/tracer)
**POWERTOOLS_TRACE_MIDDLEWARES** | Creates sub-segment for each custom middleware | [middleware_factory](./utilities/middleware_factory)
**POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT** | Logs incoming event | [Logging](./core/logger)
**POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_SAMPLE_RATE** | Debug log sampling | [Logging](./core/logger)
**LOG_LEVEL** | Sets logging level | [Logging](./core/logger)

## Debug mode

As a best practice, AWS Lambda Powertools logging statements are suppressed. If necessary, you can enable debugging using `set_package_logger`:

```python:title=app.py
from aws_lambda_powertools.logging.logger import set_package_logger

set_package_logger()
```
