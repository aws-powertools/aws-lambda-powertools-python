#### Python Serverless GitHub Template Project

This repository provides a working, deployable, open source based, AWS Lambda handler and CDK Python code. This handler embodies Serverless best practices and has all the bells and whistles for a proper production ready handler. It uses many of the AWS Lambda Powertools utilities for Python.

#### Building a resilient input handling with AWS Lambda Parser

When building applications with AWS Lambda it is critical to verify the data structure and validate the input due to the multiple different sources that can trigger them. In this session Ran Isenberg (CyberArk) will present one of the interesting features of AWS Lambda Powertools for python: the parser.

On this session you will learn how to increase code quality, extensibility and testability, boost you productivity and ship rock solid apps to production.
